			"taskTitle": "Core System Setup & Graph Engine Foundation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Core System Setup & Graph Engine Foundation' task into distinct subtasks covering: 1. Python project initialization (Poetry/PDM, linters, formatters, Python 3.11+). 2. FastAPI application setup (basic structure, lifespan events for DB/Redis). 3. SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL integration (async engine, session management, initial Alembic setup). 4. Redis integration (async connection pool setup). 5. Implementation of core graph Pydantic models (`UniversalYieldGraph`, `YieldGraphEdge`, `EdgeState`, enums).",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the foundational nature, involving multiple core technologies (Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Redis) and critical data structure design. Setting these up correctly is crucial for the entire project."

			"taskTitle": "Blockchain Interaction Layer & EVM Node Setup",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Blockchain Interaction Layer & EVM Node Setup' task into subtasks for: 1. Async Web3.py integration and `BlockchainProvider` class setup. 2. Configuration and connectivity testing for EVM node providers (Alchemy/Infura for Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Sonic, Berachain - handling missing ones gracefully). 3. Research and integration of an async-compatible Multicall library or development of a basic async batch call wrapper. 4. Implementation and testing of utility functions (`get_balance`, `get_block_number`, `get_gas_price`, basic `batch_read_contracts`).",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to async operations, managing connections to multiple external blockchain nodes, and the potential challenge of finding/implementing an async multicall solution. Requires careful handling of API keys and different chain specifics."

			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,

Design and implement the initial non-ML `_score_path_candidate` function (considering output, gas, liquidity). 5. Implement path validation (max length, cycle detection, basic profitability checks for early termination if applicable).",

Create and apply the initial Alembic migration to generate the tables in PostgreSQL.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. While ORM and database setup are standard, using async SQLAlchemy and Alembic requires careful configuration. Defining appropriate schemas for future data analysis is important."

Integrate the `MLEdgeScorer` into `BeamSearchOptimizer` as an alternative scoring mechanism.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the introduction of machine learning. This involves model design, feature engineering, setting up a training pipeline, and integrating the ML model into an existing component. PyTorch expertise is beneficial."

Implement logging of simulated execution attempts and their outcomes (success/failure, reasons) to the `ExecutedPath` table in PostgreSQL. 4. Scaffold the `PositionMonitor` class structure, including `active_positions` management and a placeholder `monitor_position` method. 5. Implement the basic `run_monitoring_loop` for `PositionMonitor` to periodically call monitoring tasks.",
